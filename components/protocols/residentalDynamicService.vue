            <p class="mt-4 text-gray-600">
                A dynamic residential agent is the middle server between you and the website you are trying to visit. 
                The server's IP address is provided by the Internet Service Provider (ISP), not the digital center. 
                Each dynamic residential IP is a real mobile or desktop device that pinpoints a specific physical location.

                        Residential agents use IP for desktop and mobile devices, making it difficult for websites 
                        to distinguish them from real users.

                        Due to their origin and advanced rotation, residential IP addresses are difficult to detect 
                        and less likely to be blocked by websites.
